                The B3 - Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. (in English, B3 - Brazil Stock Exchange and Over-the-Counter Market),
                 formerly BM&FBOVESPA, is a stock exchange located in São Paulo, Brazil, and the second oldest of the country. 
                 At the end of 2011 it had a market capitalization of R$2.37 trillion, 
                 making it the 13th largest stock exchange in the world. 
                 However, owing to the slump in economic growth in Brazil associated with political problems, 
                 in addition to the strengthening of the United States dollar against the Brazilian real, 
                 the capitalization shrank to R$2.21 trillion by the end of 2015. On May 8, 2008, 
                 the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) merged, 
                 creating BM&FBOVESPA. Then at March 30, 2017, BM&FBOVESPA merged with CETIP, creating B3.
